# Word Template Editing Guide

This guide explains how to edit document templates using Microsoft Word. The system is designed to be user-friendly for non-technical staff while maintaining all the necessary functionality.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the Templates section in the admin dashboard
2. Click on the template you want to edit
3. Click the "Download Template for Editing" button
4. Open the downloaded file in Microsoft Word

## Making Changes

### Basic Formatting
- Use Word's standard formatting tools:
  - Bold, Italic, Underline
  - Font styles and sizes
  - Alignment (left, center, right)
  - Bullet points and numbered lists
  - Tables
  - Headers and footers

### Using Placeholders
Placeholders are special tags that get replaced with actual data when generating documents. They look like this: `[resident_name]`

To use placeholders:
1. Find the placeholder you want to use in the "Available Placeholders" section on the template editing page
2. Copy the placeholder exactly as shown (including the square brackets)
3. Paste it into your Word document where you want the data to appear
4. Format the placeholder text just like any other text (font, size, bold, etc.)

Common placeholders include:
- `[resident_name]` - The resident's full name
- `[resident_address]` - The resident's address
- `[current_date]` - Current date
- `[barangay_name]` - Name of the barangay
- `[official_name]` - Name of the signing official

### Tips for Best Results
1. Use Word's built-in styles for consistent formatting
2. Save your work frequently
3. Keep the document layout clean and professional
4. Test placeholders by previewing the document after uploading

## Saving and Uploading

1. Save your changes in Word
2. Return to the template editing page in your browser
3. Click "Choose File" in the upload section
4. Select your modified Word document
5. Click "Upload Updated Template"

## Important Notes

- Only RTF (Rich Text Format) files are accepted for maximum compatibility
- RTF format works perfectly with Microsoft Word and preserves all formatting
- You can always reset to the default template if needed
- Make sure to copy placeholders exactly as shown
- Test your template after making changes
